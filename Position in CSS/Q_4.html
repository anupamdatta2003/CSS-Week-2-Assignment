                MongoDB, which is the base of the MERN stack, is designed to store JSON data natively. Everything in it, including CLI and query language, is built using JSON and JS. The NoSQL database management system works well with NodeJS and thus, allows manipulating, representing, and storing JSON data at every tier of the application.
                
                It comes in a variant called MongoDB Atlas that further eases database management by offering an auto-scaling MongoDB cluster on any cloud provider and with just a few clicks.
                
                Express is a server-side framework that wraps HTTP requests and responses and makes mapping URLs to server-side functions easy. This perfectly complements the ReactJS framework, a front-end JS framework for developing interactive UIs in HTML while communicating with the server.
                
                As the two technologies work with JSON, data flows seamlessly, making it possible to develop fast and debug easily. To make sense of the entire system, you need to understand only one language, i.e., JavaScript and the JSON document structure.Contemporary web developers with enough experience in React and JS prefer developing intuitive applications using the MERN stack. To know in-depth about using the MERN stack, you can opt for the Caltech Coding Bootcamp by Simplilearn. Offered by Caltech CTME, this program is a descriptive online bootcamp that includes 25 projects, a capstone project, and interactive online classes. In addition to the MERN stack, the course also details everything you need to become a full-stack developer.

                Simplilearn also offers free online courses in several domains, from data science and business analytics to software development, AI, and machine learning. You can take up any of these free courses to upgrade your skills and advance your career.
                
                If you have any questions, feel free to post them in the comments section below. Our team will get back to you at the earliest.Let's start with MongoDB, the document database at the root of the MERN stack. MongoDB was designed to store JSON data natively (it technically uses a binary version of JSON called 
                BSON
                ), and everything from its command line interface to its query language (MQL, or MongoDB Query Language) is built on JSON and JavaScript.
                
                MongoDB works extremely well with Node.js, and makes storing, manipulating, and representing JSON data at every tier of your application incredibly easy. For cloud-native applications, 
                MongoDB Atlas
                 makes it even easier, by giving you an auto-scaling MongoDB cluster on the cloud provider of your choice, as easy as a few button clicks.
                
                Express.js (running on Node.js) and React.js make the JavaScript/JSON application MERN full stack, well, full. Express.js is a server-side application framework that wraps HTTP requests and responses, and makes it easy to map URLs to server-side functions. React.js is a front end JavaScript framework for building interactive user interfaces in HTML, and communicating with a remote server.
                
                The combination means that JSON data flows naturally from front to back, making it fast to build on and reasonably simple to debug. Plus, you only have to know one programming language, and the JSON document structure, to understand the whole system!
                
                MERN is the stack of choice for today's web developers looking to move quickly, particularly for those with React.js experience.
